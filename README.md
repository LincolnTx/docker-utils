## Docker utils
Just a repo with a bunch of docker and docker compose files. Just the images that a common
use

### Run
If you want to run a DockerFile see the [documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/build/).
If you want to run a docker-compose, you just need to open a terminal in the folder that the yml is saved and run:
```docker-compose up``` or ```docker-compose up -d``` if you want to free up the terminal when the image is up
